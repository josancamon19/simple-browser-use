This repo aims to make a fully working implementation of a browser agent without basing on existing implementations.

It shouldn't be that hard.


- Environment -> browser
- Actions -> click, scroll, type, new tab, back ...
- Actions (exec) -> playwright, selenium, puppeteer
- Observation space -> text/visual, DOM, accessibility tree, visual
